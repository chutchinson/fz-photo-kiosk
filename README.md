# fz-photo-kiosk

A quick and simple web service developed in a few hours for a company event at [Feyen Zylstra](http://feyenzylstra.com) that communicates with a photo booth API. All photos taken in the photo booth are captured, post-processed, and displayed on a page that rotates the images at random.

The software was developed as part of an office contest for a pizza party. We attracted dozens of people to our room. In the end we walked away with the pizza, so this software is worth at least several large pizzas, or maybe about $40 USD.

## Caveats

This software was written for personal use and suffers from a lack of documentation, no warranty of any kind, and is not necessarily representative of quality work.

## Dependencies

- ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1
- ImageSharp
